# Introduction

Welcome to the Applitools Eyes SDK for Playwright documentation. This guide will help you integrate visual testing into your Playwright automation tests, enabling you to catch visual regressions and ensure your web applications look perfect across different browsers and devices.

## What is Applitools Eyes?

Applitools Eyes is a powerful visual testing and monitoring solution that uses AI-powered computer vision algorithms to mimic the human eye and brain. It allows you to:

- Automatically detect visual differences in your web applications
- Ensure consistency across different browsers, devices, and screen sizes
- Streamline your testing process by reducing manual visual checks

## Why Use Applitools with Playwright?

Playwright is an excellent tool for automating web browsers, but it doesn't inherently provide sophisticated visual testing capabilities. By integrating Applitools Eyes with your Playwright tests, you can:

1. **Enhance Test Coverage**: Add visual checks to your existing functional tests.
2. **Improve Efficiency**: Automate the process of visual regression testing.
3. **Increase Accuracy**: Leverage AI to detect visual changes that might be missed by human testers.
4. **Save Time**: Reduce the time spent on manual visual inspection and bug reproduction.
